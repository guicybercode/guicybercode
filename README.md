**`Indie Developer (Code/Hardware/Eletronics)`**

I'm Guilherme â€” a software engineer with a strong focus on Linux (Gentoo, NixOS), low-level programming (C, Rust), and mathematical thinking. I also work with Java, Python, TypeScript, and C#, building scalable applications across platforms. Experienced with cloud technologies including AWS, Azure, and Oracle OCI. I'm a multilingual communicator (Portuguese, English, Korean, Thai, Icelandic, Italian), a musician, and a Christian guided by purpose, clarity, and ethics.
