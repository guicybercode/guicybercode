### 📕 Graduation

I'm currently pursuing degrees in Information Systems and Electronic Engineering. My academic focus bridges software development, systems architecture, and low-level hardware design — combining programming, mathematics, and electronics to build efficient, purposeful technology.

### 🔖 Languages

I come from Brazil, a country known for its cultural diversity and creative energy. My background blends technical depth with global curiosity — and language has always been a gateway for me.

I'm fluent in Portuguese and English, and I've developed conversational skills in Korean, Thai, Italian and Icelandic. Each language connects me to a different culture, perspective, and way of thinking.

### 🎶 Music

Music is a core part of my identity. I'm a musician who explores sound as both emotional expression and structured design. I compose, perform, and experiment with digital and analog tools — often blending my technical background with creative intuition.


**`하나님은 나의 빛이요, 나의 구원이시니 내가 누구를 두려워하랴. God is my light and my salvation — whom shall I fear. (Salmo 27:1)`**
